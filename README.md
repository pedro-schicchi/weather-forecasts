## Introduction

Obtaining accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts is crucial for various applications. This project leverages the data from NOAA and ECMWF to fetch short-term weather forecasts. It offers tools and workflows to clean the data, store it efficiently, and create informative visualizations.

## Features

- Weather data retrieval: Fetch short-term weather forecasts from NOAA and ECMWF APIS/websites.
- Data cleaning: Preprocess the retrieved weather forecast data to ensure consistency and quality.
- Data storage: Store the cleaned weather forecast data using a suitable storage solution, such as a database or file system.
- Visualization: Generate visualizations of the weather forecast data to gain insights and facilitate analysis.

## Data Sources

The primary data sources for this project are the weather forecast APIs provided by NOAA and ECMWF. These APIs provide access to short-term weather forecasts with various parameters, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. Refer to the documentation of the respective APIs for more information on their usage and data availability.
